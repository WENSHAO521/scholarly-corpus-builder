"""Corpus/Profile Comparison Engine (PART XLIX, LIII, LVIII-LIX).

Compares two profiles (Journal A vs B, discipline eras, author vs
target journal, ...) and reports shared traits, differences, and
adaptation implications. Never mechanically averages two profiles
together (PART XXXIX) — composite synthesis keeps the author's voice as
the thing being adapted *from*, not blended away.
